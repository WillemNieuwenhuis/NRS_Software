Dear Kees,

Please find attached the source code for the python implementation of the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter used by TIMESAT v2.3.
I also included a set of tools that are needed to run the script and should be placed on the %\Python25\Lib\site-packages.
Just remember that this tools are not yet fool-proof. Not that much user friendly.

You need to have installed the python 2.5 with the following modules:
numpy, GDAL and Gnuplot.
I will come up to help you installed this in your computer.

Cheers,
Jose
